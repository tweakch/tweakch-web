# From Static HTML to Modern PHP: A Complete Website Transformation Journey

---

## Introduction: The Challenge

When I first discovered the beautiful Dopetrope template from HTML5UP, I was impressed by its clean design and responsive layout. However, as a PHP developer, I quickly realized that the static HTML structure wouldn't meet my needs for a dynamic, multilingual website. What followed was an exciting journey of transformation that took a simple HTML template and evolved it into a modern, maintainable PHP application.

In this blog post, I'll share the complete journey of how I migrated the HTML5UP Dopetrope template from static HTML to a modern PHP application with Docker containerization, multilingual support, Composer dependency management, and Twig templating.

## Phase 1: The Foundation - HTML to PHP Migration

### Starting Point: Static HTML

The original Dopetrope template consisted of:

- `index.html` - Homepage with portfolio and blog sections
- `left-sidebar.html` - Page with left sidebar layout
- `right-sidebar.html` - Page with right sidebar layout  
- `no-sidebar.html` - Full-width page layout
- CSS/JS assets for styling and interactivity

### The First Transformation

My first step was converting these static HTML files to dynamic PHP pages:

```php
// Before: Static HTML
<title>Dopetrope by HTML5 UP</title>

// After: Dynamic PHP
<?php
$pageTitle = 'Home | ' . $SITE_NAME;
?>
<title><?php echo htmlspecialchars($pageTitle); ?></title>
```

**Key Changes Made:**

- Created `includes/header.php` and `includes/footer.php` for shared components
- Added `includes/config.php` for global configuration
- Converted hardcoded content to PHP variables
- Implemented basic security with `htmlspecialchars()`

**Results:**
✅ Eliminated code duplication  
✅ Created maintainable structure  
✅ Added security best practices  

## Phase 2: Containerization with Docker

### The Need for Consistency

Working with different PHP versions and environments can be challenging. To ensure consistency across development and production, I decided to containerize the application.

### Docker Implementation

I created a multi-service Docker setup:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
      - ./docker/nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

  php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/php/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html

  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: dopetrope
      MYSQL_USER: dopetrope
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: db
```

**Services Included:**

- **Nginx (Port 8080):** Web server
- **PHP-FPM:** PHP processing  
- **MariaDB:** Database for future features
- **phpMyAdmin (Port 8081):** Database management

**Results:**
✅ Consistent development environment  
✅ Easy deployment and scaling  
✅ Isolated dependencies  
✅ Version-controlled infrastructure  

## Phase 3: Multilingual Magic

### The Vision: Global Reach

I wanted the website to support multiple languages seamlessly. This required building a robust internationalization (i18n) system.

### Custom Language System

I created a singleton-based language management system:

```php
// Language.php
class Language
{
    private static ?Language $instance = null;
    private array $translations = [];
    private string $currentLanguage = 'en';

    public function get(string $key): string
    {
        $keys = explode('.', $key);
        $value = $this->translations;
        
        foreach ($keys as $keyPart) {
            if (isset($value[$keyPart])) {
                $value = $value[$keyPart];
            } else {
                return $key; // Return key if translation not found
            }
        }
        
        return is_string($value) ? $value : $key;
    }
}
```

### Translation Structure

I organized translations in JSON files with dot notation:

```json
// en.json
{
  "site": {
    "name": "TWIːK",
    "description": "A responsive HTML5 + CSS3 site template..."
  },
  "nav": {
    "home": "Home",
    "left_sidebar": "Left Sidebar"
  },
  "banner": {
    "title": "Alexander Klee",
    "subtitle": "A responsive template by HTML5 UP"
  }
}
```

**Features Implemented:**

- URL parameter language switching (`?lang=de`)
- Session persistence for language preference
- Fallback to default language for missing translations
- Dot notation for nested translation keys

**Results:**
✅ Full English/German language support  
✅ SEO-friendly language switching  
✅ Maintainable translation system  
✅ Easy addition of new languages  

## Phase 4: Modern PHP with Composer

### Embracing Modern Standards

Static file includes and manual dependency management were becoming unwieldy. It was time to embrace modern PHP practices.

### Composer Integration

I introduced Composer for dependency management and autoloading:

```json
{
    "name": "tweakch/dopetrope-php",
    "description": "Modern PHP version of HTML5 UP Dopetrope template",
    "require": {
        "php": ">=8.2",
        "twig/twig": "^3.21",
        "vlucas/phpdotenv": "^5.6"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

### Namespace Restructuring

I migrated from global classes to PSR-4 namespaced architecture:

```php
// Before: Global class
class Language { }

// After: Namespaced class  
namespace App\i18n;
class Language { }
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
✅ Professional dependency management  
✅ PSR-4 autoloading standards  
✅ Type declarations and strict typing  
✅ Modern PHP 8.2 features  

## Phase 5: Template Engine Revolution with Twig

### The Final Transformation

The biggest challenge was separating presentation from logic. Mixed PHP/HTML was becoming difficult to maintain, especially with the growing complexity of the multilingual system.

### Why Twig?

Twig offered several advantages:

- **Clean syntax:** `{{ variable }}` instead of `<?php echo $variable; ?>`
- **Auto-escaping:** Built-in XSS protection
- **Template inheritance:** DRY principle implementation
- **Professional standard:** Industry-standard template engine

### Template Architecture

I created a hierarchical template structure:

```txt
templates/
├── layouts/
│   └── base.html.twig (Master layout)
└── pages/
    ├── homepage.html.twig
    ├── left-sidebar.html.twig
    ├── right-sidebar.html.twig
    └── no-sidebar.html.twig
```

### Template Service Layer

I built a service layer to manage Twig configuration:

```php
namespace App\Services;

class TemplateService
{
    private Environment $twig;
    private Language $language;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $loader = new FilesystemLoader(__DIR__ . '/../../templates');
        $this->twig = new Environment($loader, [
            'cache' => __DIR__ . '/../../var/cache/twig',
            'debug' => true,
            'auto_reload' => true,
        ]);

        $this->language = Language::getInstance();
        $this->addGlobalVariables();
    }

    private function addGlobalVariables(): void
    {
        $this->twig->addGlobal('site', [
            'name' => $this->language->get('site.name'),
            'description' => $this->language->get('site.description'),
            'author' => $this->language->get('site.author'),
        ]);

        $this->twig->addGlobal('lang', $this->language);
        $this->twig->addGlobal('current_page', basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] ?? ''));
    }
}
```

### Before and After Comparison

**Before (Mixed PHP/HTML):**

```php
<?php include __DIR__ . '/includes/header.php'; ?>
<section id="banner">
    <header>
        <h2><?php echo htmlspecialchars($lang->get('banner.title')); ?></h2>
        <p><?php echo htmlspecialchars($lang->get('banner.subtitle')); ?></p>
    </header>
</section>
<?php include __DIR__ . '/includes/footer.php'; ?>
```

**After (Clean Twig):**

```php
// PHP Controller
echo $twig->render('pages/homepage.html.twig', [
    'page_title' => $pageTitle,
    'body_class' => $bodyClass,
    'intro_sections' => $introSections,
]);
```

```twig
{# Twig Template #}
{% extends 'layouts/base.html.twig' %}

{% block content %}
<section id="banner">
    <header>
        <h2>{{ lang.get('banner.title') }}</h2>
        <p>{{ lang.get('banner.subtitle') }}</p>
    </header>
</section>
{% endblock %}
```

**Results:**
✅ Complete separation of concerns  
✅ Maintainable template inheritance  
✅ Built-in security features  
✅ Clean, readable syntax  

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Language Integration with Twig

**Problem:** Making the Language class accessible in Twig templates  
**Solution:** Added the Language instance as a global variable in TemplateService

### Challenge 2: Template Cache Management  

**Problem:** Twig cache not updating during development  
**Solution:** Enabled auto_reload and debug mode for development environment
