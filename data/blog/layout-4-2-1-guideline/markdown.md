> We are formalizing a shift from the theme's de‑facto 3→1 layout toward an explicit 4‑2‑1 grid: 4 columns (large), 2 (medium), 1 (small). This post evaluates feasibility, trade‑offs, and shows concrete before/after code.

## Reality Check: What We Actually Have Today

The current code base does **not** expose a formal "3-column layout component"; instead, multiple legacy float/flex constructs + percentage widths (notably `33.3333333333%` in compiled CSS) simulate *three-up* groupings at wider breakpoints and collapse to one column below `medium`.

### Observed Characteristics

- Breakpoints map (from `main.scss`):
  - `xlarge: (1281px, 1680px)`
  - `large: (981px, 1280px)`
  - `medium: (737px, 980px)`
  - `small: (null, 736px)`
- Compiled CSS shows repeated `width: 33.3333333333%` & matching `margin-left` patterns—classic float grid remnants.
- No shared abstraction for *n-up* arrangements: each section duplicates structural rules.

### Pain Points

- Hard to evolve: adding a 4th column requires touching multiple bespoke blocks.
- Medium breakpoint underutilized: still effectively rendering three columns where two would enhance readability.
- Accessibility risk: visual order relies on source order + float clearing hacks rather than a semantic grid.

## Why Move to 4‑2‑1?

| Goal | How 4‑2‑1 Helps |
| ---- | -------------- |
| Predictable scaling | Each step halves/doubles columns (1 → 2 → 4). |
| Better medium UX | 2 columns avoids cramped text at ~1000–1200px widths. |
| Higher density at large | 4 columns lowers scroll depth on wide desktops. |
| Cleaner authoring | Single utility / component instead of scattered ad‑hoc widths. |
| Future container queries | Grid abstraction maps cleanly to container-driven adaptations later. |

## Definition: 4‑2‑1 in This Codebase

- **Large (≥ 981px)**: Use 4 columns only at `large` and up *after* verifying card minimum width (≥ 16ch). (We can optionally limit 4 columns to `xlarge` if density feels tight in the lower portion of `large`.)
- **Medium (737px – 980px)**: 2 columns—this is the biggest ergonomic win.
- **Small (≤ 736px)**: 1 column—unchanged.

We reuse the existing breakpoint map; no Sass variable changes required for phase 1.

## Design Principles (Refined)

1. **Progressive Density**: Introduce additional columns only when line length and tap targets remain acceptable.
2. **Intrinsic Sizing First**: Cards avoid fixed heights; let content flow so quarter-width does not force truncation.
3. **Single Source of Truth**: A `.grid-responsive` (working name) utility centralizes column logic.
4. **Non-Destructive Migration**: Keep legacy structures functional until each section opts in.
5. **Order Preservation**: DOM order = reading order; grid is visual only.

## Current vs Target Behavior

| Tier (existing map) | Current Emergent Columns | Target Columns |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| xlarge (1281–1680)  | 3                        | 4 |
| large  (981–1280)   | 3                        | 4 (or conditionally 3→4) |
| medium (737–980)    | 3 (squeezed)             | 2 |
| small  (≤ 736)      | 1                        | 1 |

## BEFORE: Typical Legacy Markup + Styles

```html
<div class="features">
  <div class="feature">...</div>
  <div class="feature">...</div>
  <div class="feature">...</div>
  <!-- more -->
</div>
```

```scss
// (Representative, simplified – compiled CSS shows 33.333% width chains)
.features .feature {
  float: left;
  width: 33.3333333333%;
  padding: 2rem 2rem 0 2rem;
}

@include breakpoint('<=medium') {
  .features .feature { width: 100%; float: none; }
}
```

Issues:

- Repeated patterns across sections.
- Float clearing & margin-left hacks increase complexity.
- Medium remains 3-up reducing legibility.

## AFTER: Unified Grid Utility

```html
<div class="grid-4-2-1">
  <article class="card">...</article>
  <article class="card">...</article>
  <article class="card">...</article>
  <article class="card">...</article>
  <!-- etc. -->
</div>
```

```scss
.grid-responsive {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem; // revisit scale later
  grid-template-columns: 1fr; // small

  @include breakpoint('>=medium') { // 737px+
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }

  @include breakpoint('>=large') { // 981px+
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}

// Optional: constrain very wide cards within each cell
.grid-responsive .card { max-width: 60ch; }
```

If we decide 4 columns should only activate at `xlarge` to reduce crowding around 1000–1100px widths:

```scss
@include breakpoint('>=xlarge') {
  .grid-responsive { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement Path

1. Add the utility class (non-breaking) alongside legacy CSS.
2. Migrate one template section (e.g. blog index cards) and visually QA.
3. Assess line lengths at 4-up across the `large` range; if cramped, gate 4-up behind `xlarge` only.
4. Remove float-based width declarations once all target sections adopt the utility.
5. Introduce container-query refinement later (e.g. `@container (min-width: 1100px)` for 4-up activation).

## Migration Strategy (Detailed)

### 1. Audit & Tag

List every template where a multi-column card or feature grouping appears. Tag each with: density OK? text wrapping issues? image aspect dependencies?

### 2. Introduce Utility (No Consumers Yet)

Ship `.grid-responsive` in Sass; no markup changes. This isolates any cascade side-effects in review.

### 3. Pilot Section

Apply to a low-risk area (e.g. portfolio or blog index). Measure:

- Average card line length (ideal 45–75 chars).
- CLS differences (Lighthouse or Web Vitals overlay).

### 4. Conditional 4-Up Decision

If cards feel cramped at the lower edge of `large` (981–1100px), defer 4-up to `xlarge`.

### 5. Batch Migrate Remaining Sections

Replace legacy wrapper classes with the utility; remove float-specific overrides only after visual parity confirmed.

### 6. Decommission Legacy Percent Widths

Search & eliminate `width: 33.333` & paired margin hacks; simplify markup if extra clearfix elements exist.

### 7. Post-Migration Refinements

- Adjust `gap` scale for vertical rhythm.
- Consider semantic variants (e.g. `.grid-cards`, `.grid-features`) if different spacing tokens emerge.

### 8. (Optional) Container Query Phase

Wrap the grid in a size container and refine activation thresholds independent of viewport.

## Content Block Readiness Checklist

Each migrating module should:

- Avoid fixed widths (prefer max-width + padding).
- Provide intrinsic image handling (`height: auto; max-width: 100%`).
- Keep interactive targets ≥ 44px in both dimensions.
- Avoid relying on nth-child layout hacks for visual grouping.
- Ensure headings do not exceed ~2 lines at quarter width.
- Defer non-critical media (lazy-load below fold) to protect LCP.

## FAQ

### Why not 5 columns on ultra-wide?

Readability decays and cognitive load rises; 4-up balances density and scanning speed.

### Could we just keep 3→1 and add a single 2-col breakpoint?

Yes, but then large screens remain underutilized & the mental model becomes 3→2→1 (non-power-of-two). 4‑2‑1 offers cleaner scaling.

### Will this hurt performance?

Grid itself is cheap. Risk lies in more simultaneous imagery above the fold; mitigate with responsive image sizes & lazy loading.

### What about masonry / uneven heights?

Start uniform. Add masonry only where content entropy (varying heights) materially hurts scan efficiency.

### Do images need regeneration?

Rarely. Only extremely wide banner-like assets may look cramped at quarter width; audit during pilot.

## Next Steps

1. Approve scope (4-up at large vs xlarge) & naming.
2. Implement `.grid-responsive` utility (phase 1: inactive in templates).
3. Pilot on blog index → collect readability + CLS metrics.
4. Decide activation threshold for 4-up (large vs xlarge).
5. Migrate remaining multi-column sections; remove float rules.
6. Document in design system & add usage examples.
7. Plan container query iteration (optional).

Adopting 4‑2‑1 turns implicit, duplicated layout logic into a deliberate, evolvable grid strategy. Feedback & pilot findings will shape whether 4-up activates at `large` or only at `xlarge`.
