After implementing a component-based template architecture and planning for our innovative **C18N** feature, the next logical step was creating a blog system that combined flexibility with maintainability.

Traditional approaches force a trade-off: either adopt a full CMS with unnecessary overhead, or manage static HTML/PHP files that quickly become unmanageable. We wanted a **middle ground**—something that preserved the simplicity of markdown while taking advantage of our Twig-based rendering system.

The result is our new **dynamic blog engine**: a lightweight solution that transforms markdown into fully rendered posts, with SEO support, metadata handling, and future-proof extensibility.

### The Pain of Static Files

Our original blog posts were written as standalone PHP files, each with duplicated boilerplate. This led to several issues:

* **Content overhead**: every new post required manual PHP setup.
* **Maintainability**: HTML mixed with logic made diffs unreadable.
* **Collaboration limits**: non-technical contributors couldn’t edit content easily.
* **SEO and URL rigidity**: metadata was scattered, and slugs were tied to file names.

#### The Vision

We needed a system that:

1. **Separates content from code**—writers write markdown, developers focus on features.
2. **Supports metadata and markdown natively**—titles, descriptions, tags.
3. **Reuses our Twig architecture**—consistent layouts and components.
4. **Generates SEO-friendly URLs**—slug-based routing with clean URL support.
5. **Prepares for C18N**—dynamic content variation by expertise level.

### How the Blog Engine Works

#### Directory and URL Structure

Posts live in a simple folder hierarchy:

```text
/blog/
/c18n-feature/markdown.md
/template-refactoring/markdown.md
/migration-journey/markdown.md
```

Accessible via clean URLs:

```bash
## Dynamic routing
https://site.com/blog.php?post=c18n-feature
## With .htaccess rewrite
https://site.com/blog/c18n-feature
```

#### The Parser

A custom `BlogPostParser` reads the markdown file, extracts metadata (from YAML frontmatter or inline), and converts content into HTML:

```php
$parser = new BlogPostParser('blog/c18n-feature/markdown.md');
echo $twig->render('pages/blog-post.html.twig', [
    'page_title' => $parser->getTitle(),
    'main_content' => [
        'title' => $parser->getTitle(),
        'content' => $parser->getContent(),
        'metadata' => $parser->getMetadata()
    ]
]);
```

#### Features in Action

* **Markdown rendering**: headers, code blocks, links, and formatting.
* **Metadata extraction**: title, author, tags, description.
* **Enhancements**:

  * Automatic reading time calculation.
  * Table of contents generation.
  * Dynamic meta tags for SEO and social sharing.

#### Content Workflow

A new post requires only:

```bash
mkdir blog/my-new-post
touch blog/my-new-post/markdown.md
```

Then write:

```markdown

Markdown makes writing content simple…
```

The system handles everything else: rendering, SEO metadata, and clean presentation.

## Conclusion

By moving from static PHP pages to a markdown-driven engine, we achieved:

* **Cleaner separation of concerns**: code, templates, and content are decoupled.
* **A streamlined workflow**: creating a new post takes seconds.
* **Collaboration and version control**: diffs are readable, content is accessible.
* **Performance without a database**: file-based caching keeps it fast and secure.

Most importantly, this approach lays the groundwork for **C18N**—allowing future blog posts to adapt to different expertise levels without duplicating effort.

The blog system is now not only a publishing tool, but also a flexible platform ready for advanced features like tag-based navigation, search, RSS, and AI-powered enhancements.
