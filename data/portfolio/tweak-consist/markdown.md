## Overview

tweak-consist is an automation-focused repository that enforces workflow standards across the `tweakch` GitHub organization. It inventories repositories, evaluates the presence of critical workflows (CI, CodeQL, Dependabot), generates compliance reports (Markdown + PDF), and can automatically deploy missing standardized workflows. The system reduces configuration drift, accelerates security adoption, and provides governance reporting with zero runtime application code.

## Problem / Context

As the organization scaled to dozens of repositories, workflow fragmentation emerged: missing CI pipelines, absent CodeQL scanning, and inconsistent dependency update strategies. Manual audits were slow, error-prone, and infrequent. Security posture and release reliability risked degradation without a centralized, automated compliance mechanism.

## Objectives

- Establish repeatable, auditable workflow compliance across all active repositories.
- Automate detection of missing CI, security scanning, and dependency update workflows.
- Provide human-readable and machine-consumable compliance reports for stakeholders.
- Enable one-click remediation via standardized workflow deployment.
- Minimize operational overhead (no extra runtime services or databases).
- Support safe dry-run inspection before enforcement.

## Architecture / Approach

- **GitHub Actions First**: Entire system implemented as workflows + composite actions; no external infrastructure.
- **Repository Inventory**: Uses `gh repo list` with structured JSON export for enumeration.
- **Consistency Engine**: Composite action inspects each repository via GitHub REST API for required files:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
  - `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Reporting Layer**: Generates JSON (`tweakch-workflow-consistency.json`) + Markdown + optional PDF via Pandoc/XeTeX.
- **Remediation Workflow**: Deployment workflow can perform dry run or live push of standardized templates.
- **Template Set**: Centralized under `.github/workflow-templates/` (CI multi-language, CodeQL multi-runtime, Dependabot multi-ecosystem).
- **Idempotent Operations**: Deploy step skips existing files unless `force_update` is explicitly set.
- **Security**: Relies only on ephemeral GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no persistent secrets.
- **Scalability**: Linear scan with bounded API requests (per-repo metadata + content probes); suitable for 100+ repos.

## Key Contributions

- **Designed** a zero-infrastructure compliance platform using only native GitHub capabilities.
- **Implemented** composite actions for auditing, reporting, preparation, validation, dry-run, and deployment phases.
- **Standardized** CI, CodeQL, and Dependabot workflows with language auto-detection and multi-ecosystem coverage.
- **Automated** PDF and Markdown report generation for stakeholder consumption.
- **Enabled** safe remediation via dry-run + force-update flags preventing accidental overwrites.
- **Optimized** API usage pattern to avoid rate limiting while scanning 60+ repositories.
- **Improved** security posture by ensuring CodeQL coverage adoption across all active repositories.
- **Established** governance metrics (compliance rate, missing workflow breakdown) for ongoing tracking.

## Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Inconsistent repository defaults (main vs master) | Implemented default branch detection per repo before template deployment. |
| Missing or archived repositories causing failures | Added exclusion + archived filtering within prepare-deployment action. |
| Potential YAML syntax drift in templates | Added validation composite action (YAML parse + existence check). |
| Risk of overwriting bespoke workflows | Introduced explicit `force_update` gate and default non-destructive create mode. |
| Large org scans timing out in busy periods | Added conservative timeouts + retry-safe sequential probing. |
| Reporting needed both machine + human formats | Generated JSON + Markdown + optional PDF artifacts. |

## Impact / Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Repositories with all three standard workflows | ~0% | >95% (target) | +95 pp |
| Time to audit all repos | ~2 hours manual | <3 minutes automated | >95% faster |
| Security scanning coverage (CodeQL) | Sparse / ad hoc | Organization-wide baseline | Consistent coverage |
| Dependency update automation | Fragmented | Unified Dependabot config | Reduced drift |
| Onboarding effort for new repos | Ad hoc copy/paste | Single workflow run | Streamlined |

## Tooling / Stack Details

- **Languages**: Bash for scripting within workflows.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (workflow + composite actions).
- **CLI**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repository enumeration and content operations.
- **Formats**: JSON for machine data, Markdown + PDF for human consumption.
- **Templating**: Centralized YAML workflow templates for CI, security, and dependency automation.
- **Document Generation**: Pandoc + XeTeX (on-demand) via composite action.

## Lessons Learned

- Leveraging only platform-native primitives reduces maintenance and increases adoption velocity.
- Dry-run mechanisms build stakeholder trust before enforcing changes.
- Idempotent, declarative remediation enables safe re-runs without side effects.
- Central template evolution accelerates org-wide improvements (e.g., adding a new language matrix once).

## Roadmap / Next Steps

- Add Renovate config detection as alternative to Dependabot.
- Introduce signed commits for workflow deployment for enhanced provenance.
- Expand security checks (Secret scanning, Code scanning SARIF aggregation summary).
- Add historical trend graphs (compliance over time) to Markdown report.
- Integrate a lightweight rate-limit aware parallel scanning strategy.
- Provide Slack/Teams notification integration for compliance deltas.
