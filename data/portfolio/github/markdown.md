## Overview

I treat GitHub as a continuous laboratory: focused repositories that demonstrate patterns, architectural decisions, or developer experience improvements.

## Problem / Context

Scattered example repos often become stale, undocumented, or inconsistent in tooling—reducing their educational value and discouraging outside contribution.

## Objectives

- Provide concise, well-documented reference implementations.
- Encode repeatable automation patterns (security, quality gates).
- Maintain low cognitive load via consistent structure.
- Reduce dependency & configuration drift across repos.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Modular PHP Starter

Layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure):

- Thin Symfony Console entrypoint.
- Asynchronous pipeline examples with Messenger.
- Contract tests for external API integrations.

### 2. Twig Component Sandbox

Atomic component experimentation + story harness:

- Auto-screenshots via Playwright.
- Accessibility assertions in PR checks.
- Visual regression diffs stored as compressed PNG masks.

### 3. CI/CD Templates

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows:

- Dependency audit & cache restore matrix.
- Conventional commits + automated release notes.
- Security scanning (Trivy + CodeQL) gating protected branches.

## Automation Stack

| Layer | Tooling |
|-------|---------|
| Static Analysis | PHPStan, Psalm (experimental hybrid), ESLint, Stylelint |
| Tests | PHPUnit, Pest (selected repos), Vitest (TS libs) |
| Packaging | Docker multi-stage, Git tags, semantic-version scripts |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases, gh-pages (docs), Packagist (PHP libs) |

Nightly workflows run a meta-sync job ensuring dependency freshness; stale dependency PRs are auto-labeled and batched to reduce noise.

## Documentation Approach

Each repo includes a `docs/` directory containing:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- 1-minute Quickstart path.
- Maintenance policy (support window, versioning strategy).

Result: reduced onboarding friction & fewer recurring setup questions.

## Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Resolution | Outcome |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Tooling drift across repos | Centralized reusable workflow templates | Consistent automation surface |
| Slow initial contributor ramp | Added Quickstart + ADR rationale | Faster first-PR turnaround |
| Security scanning fatigue | Batched consolidated alerts + severity labeling | Focused remediation |
| Visual regression noise | Masked diff regions + thresholding | Lower false positives |

## Impact / Results

- >95% workflow success rate (last quarter).
- Mean PR time-to-merge: <14 hours (excludes intentionally parked PRs).
- Drop in “how to run” questions after Quickstart adoption (qualitative support log review).

## Lessons Learned

- Consistent scaffolding reduces cognitive overhead more than additional automation bells & whistles.
- ADRs prevent architecture debates from resurfacing every few months.
- Security scanning value increases when noise is aggressively filtered.

## Roadmap / Next Steps

- Reusable SARIF normalization action.
- Remote dev containers pre-provisioned for starter repos.
- Expand visual regression harness to docs sites.
