## Overview

The Cardano Developer Portal is a central knowledge hub for builders integrating with Cardano. My contributions focused on **improving navigation clarity**, **reducing onboarding friction**, and **hardening content build reliability**.

## Problem / Context

- Tutorial flow fragmentation led to premature exits.
- Inconsistent code sample formatting reduced copy/paste reliability.
- Missing prerequisite clarity generated repeat support interventions.
- Broken external links accumulated due to ecosystem evolution.

## Objectives

- Restructure navigation for linear learning progression.
- Standardize tutorial scaffolding (prereqs → steps → validation → next steps).
- Enforce consistent code block language tagging.
- Introduce automated link integrity + spelling checks.

## Contribution Areas

| Area | Contribution | Impact |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Information Architecture | Restructured sidebar groups & cross-links | Reduced page exit rates on core tutorials |
| Tutorial Quality | Added prerequisite callouts + environment setup sections | Fewer repeat support questions |
| Code Samples | Normalized formatting & language tags | Consistent syntax highlighting & copy reliability |
| API References | Clarified rate limit boundaries & error payload structure | Faster integration debugging |
| CI Quality | Added link checker & spell check jobs | Prevented broken link regressions |

## Key Contributions

### Navigation Refinement

- Merged overlapping categories ("Smart Contracts" & "Plutus") into a layered progression.
- Added sibling links at tutorial ends for forward momentum.

### Tutorial Enhancements

- Introduced uniform sections: *Overview*, *Prerequisites*, *Steps*, *Validation*, *Next Steps*.
- Provided shell-neutral command patterns (avoiding bash-onlyisms) to support Windows developers.

### Build & CI Improvements

- Added GitHub Action for external link validation (batched to avoid rate limit noise).
- Implemented markdown lint config with a curated rule set (clarity > dogma).
- Automated screenshot dimension checks to maintain visual consistency.

### Content Consistency

- Unified tense & voice guidelines in an authoring note.
- Reworked ambiguous headings for scanability and TOC usability.

---

## Impact / Results

- More predictable tutorial flow reduced context switching.
- Early environment validation steps prevented later cryptic failures.
- Link checker caught stale ecosystem references during network reorg announcements.

---

## Process & Collaboration

Pull requests were structured with labeled sections (Context, Change Summary, Affected Pages, Validation). I maintained small, review-friendly diffs to keep velocity high while minimizing merge friction.

## Challenges & Resolutions

| Challenge | Resolution | Outcome |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Fragmented tutorial structure | Unified template w/ consistent section flow | Lower abandonment during mid-steps |
| Stale external links | Automated link checker + batch scheduling | Early detection; fewer dead references |
| Inconsistent code blocks | Standardized fenced language + linting | Reliable syntax highlighting |
| Repetitive environment issues | Added explicit prerequisite blocks | Fewer setup-related support tickets |

## Impact & Results (Expanded)

- Tutorial abandonment reduced (qualitative analytics review post-structure change).
- Faster contributor onboarding due to standardized PR templates.
- Reduced support churn on environment issues after prerequisite clarity.

## Lessons Learned

- Lightweight lint/validation automation yields disproportionate editorial quality gains.
- Consistent structural patterns amplify contributor velocity and reviewer focus.

## Roadmap & Suggestions (Proposed)

- Automated snippet tests (compile/execute) for code reliability.
- Structured front matter taxonomy for discoverability (difficulty, time estimate, prereq tags).
- Progressive disclosure for advanced topics (collapsible deep dives).
- API schema drift alerting (diff nightly vs. upstream spec).
